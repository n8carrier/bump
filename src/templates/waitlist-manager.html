		<h3>Give your Guests Freedom</h3>
		<p>
			Do you enjoy a half hour wait in the lobby for your table? Neither do your guests. 
			They also don't like being constrained to 100 feet by restaurant pager systems. With 
			Bump, you can allow your guests to sign up for text or email notifications 
			when their table is ready. That way they can do what <em>they</em> want while they wait.
		</p>

			<li>Allow guests to sign up for SMS or Email notifications through a tablet interface</li>
			<li>Offer your guests the opportunity to sign up for coupons and promos</li>
			<li>Eliminate the need to invest in expensive pager systems</li>
