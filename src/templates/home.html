		<h3>Text/Email Notifications for Guests</h3>
		<p>
			Do you enjoy a half hour wait in the lobby for your table? Neither do your guests. 
			They also don't like being constrained to 100 feet by your pager system. With 
			Bump you can allow your guests to sign up for text or email notifications 
			when their table is ready. That way they can do what <em>they</em> want while they wait.

		<h3>Close the Loop</h3>
		<p>
			Looking for insight into when your guests will actually be ready to be seated? Guess no longer. 
			Bump gives you the power to send notifications to your guests and let's them 
			respond if they're running late. That gives you the power to keep your tables full and your 
			guests happy.

		<h3>Gain Marketing Insights</h3>
		<p>
			Bump allows you to gain insight into the frequency of visits of your loyal 
			customers. Have you noticed some of your main customers have been coming less frequently? 
			Send them coupons and promos to keep them coming. As long as your guests have checked the 
			box to allow you to send coupons and promos, you have the power to leverage targeted advertising 
			and keep your business running well.
